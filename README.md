# Customer Behaviour Dashboard | Python, SQL & Power BI

# Project Overview
This end-to-end data analytics project analyzes customer behaviour and purchasing
patterns using Python for data preprocessing, SQL for data analysis, and
Power BI for interactive visualization. The dashboard provides insights into
customer segmentation, subscription impact, category performance, and age-wise
sales trends to support data-driven decision-making.

#  Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy) – Data cleaning and preprocessing
- SQL – Data analysis and KPI calculations
- Power BI Desktop – Data visualization and dashboarding
- Excel – Raw dataset

# Project Workflow
1. Cleaned and prepared raw customer data using Python (handled nulls, formatting)
2. Loaded processed data into SQL database
3. Used SQL queries to calculate KPIs and aggregations
4. Connected SQL outputs to Power BI
5. Built an interactive dashboard with slicers and KPIs
